## Writing New Stories
To write new stories/articles you create a new file in the **_posts** directory. The file for a story follows the following naming convention.

YEAR-MONTH-DATE-POST_TITLE.md

#### If you do not specify the image, the article will try to look for a file named as the permalink

> At the moment, this template only supports **.jpg** images

Images for the stories live in the **assets/posts** folder
