We talked to people to find out more.</span></p>

She went on to say that she'd been talking about it a lot with co-workers. "I mean, when you don't know what else to say, why not condemn people you don't know on an issue that seems safe to have a strong opinion about?"</span></p>

When asked what he would be doing with his time had he not chosen to take to social media to perform a public outcry, the man shrugged and said "I don't know. I guess spending time with my family?"</span></p>

It's very difficult not to have your own associations with the experience, and this gives you a chance to talk about it on an even deeper level. Maybe we've even used a bathroom with a transgender person and didn't even know it! That discussion alone has fueled hours of conversation that may have otherwise been filled talking about the weather or a hobby.</span></p>

After extensive scientific research, they've come to believe that people of all kinds enjoy getting riled up so they can see and hear the shocked that stems from having an opinion about a national discussion.</span></p>
