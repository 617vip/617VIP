A Lancaster, New Hampshire man is facing a lawsuit brought by area residents who say he disturbed their peace and caused emotional stress by constantly preaching to them about the benefits of changing their phone service to Verizon. He allegedly went door to door telling people how he had tried cell phone service from Nextel, Sprint, and other services before he found Verizon, and eventually his neighbors had enough. It was also alleged that he used a bullhorn at a community event to preach his message to a large and unappreciative audience.

Verizon had no comment, but their legal services were handling the man's lawsuit.They also announced the were buying him a new Prius and having it painted with the Verizon company colors.
