In a controversial new study, scientists have came to the conclusion that of all the times to start a new diet plan, Thanksgiving is the worst.

For some reason this holiday, centered around decadent food and family expectations makes starting a new diet more difficult. The study did not determine whether it was the hours of appetizers available pre-meal, the main dinner with several recipes calling for real butter and cream, or the miles of different dessert choices that ruin a diet plan. Or perhaps it is the piles of leftovers that psychologically, you feel the need to eat before the expiration. Regardless of the specific item that ruins a dieters plans this time of year, the study is clear. Do not start a diet in November if you want any chance of success.

Future studies will inform inquisitive minds whether they should start a new novel the night before finals, or if filing for bankruptcy to afford a cruise is a good idea.
